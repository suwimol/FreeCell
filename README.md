The game was built using [Model-View-Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) design pattern along with the [Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) design pattern. It is developed in such a way that the sequence of commands given by the users are read by the program’s controller. The program then checks the validity of the player’s move before approving the move. </br></br>It was a great practice in implementing an interface based on given specifications by choosing an appropriate data representation that helps in providing the functionality promised by the interface.
